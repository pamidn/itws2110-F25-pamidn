Lab 1:
- In this lab we were instructed to create our CV/Resume and ensure that its up to date on all of our accolades and experiences throughout our lives. I was able to include my schooling years, as well as oppurtunities and job experiences. I did run into a problem with scrolling on the page itself, but once I got added of the "overflow:scroll ", I was able to fix it and ensure that everything was perfect!
