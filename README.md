Lab 1:
- In this lab we were instructed to create our CV/Resume and ensure that its up to date on all of our accolades and experiences throughout our lives. I was able to include my schooling years, as well as oppurtunities and job experiences. I did run into a problem with scrolling on the page itself, but once I got added of the "overflow:scroll ", I was able to fix it and ensure that everything was perfect!

Lab 2:
- In this lab we were instructed to analyze the Consitution and make our own interactive site to learn more about the document. In honor of National Consitution Day (9/17) we were told to analyze the Ammendments and Articles, as well as providing an overview of the history of this sacred document. We ran into some issues when we were formatting our site with the CSS and HTML, but we were able to fix it accordingly! We also added stars to both the top and bottom of the document and so formatting the 'divs' to make sure it was oerfectly centered and colored was a challenge but we were able to fix it!

Lab 3:
- In this lab we were given directions to utilize the OpenWeatherMap API and Dog CEO â€” to display real-time weather data for Troy, NY, along with a random dog image for fun. The app shows the current temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed, includes a weather emoji that matches the conditions, and displays the last updated time. The background uses a smooth gradient that changes color based on the temperature, shifting from blue when cold to green when mild and red when hot. People can also click a button to view a new random dog image at any time. The app retrieves weather data through the OpenWeatherMap API and random dog images from the Dog CEO API.  
The APIs used are documented at https://openweathermap.org/api and https://dog.ceo/dog-api/.
