Quiz 1:
-   Here in this quiz, you can cleatly see each and every file that is labeled correctly 
to ensure that everything is seamless and easy to see. First everything is under the quiz1
folder and you can see the writeup and the readme file in it. When you click into the 
"my-restaurant" folder you will see the data, resources, as well as the index.html file hosted in the folder. In the data file, I put the menu.json file in that to differentiate the data of my dishes and everything we were told to put in it. In resources I have three subfolders: css, img, and js. In the css folder I have my styles.css, in the img folder I have all my pictures, and in the js folder I have my script.js file. All of these files have been placed in there respective folders to make it easier to read and see when grading as well as formatting!
