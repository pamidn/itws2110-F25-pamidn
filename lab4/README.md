Lab 4:
- For this lab we were instructed to completely reconstruct our Lab 3, but only using Generative AI. Listed below are the prompts I got to construct the web app I was given.

1. Create a web application that includes data from a Weather API and another API to showcase it in a fun way.

2. Why is the weather data not uploading?

3. Use this API key "2738bcc73639fddc762f871fc4a9088e" 

4. Can you make it pretty with the updated code

5. No, make the boxes next to each other not one on top of the other, and change the background to a nice color

6. Split code into index.html, sc.js, and styles.css

7. Make the gradient background change based on the temperature.
